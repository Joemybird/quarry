Project is created for the ComputerCraft mod:

# Quarry

Project used to mine a Quarry all the way down to bedrock in minecraft. Files may depend on different versions of computercraft depending and will include the computercraft version that it functions in within it's filename.

# Grid Program

The /grid directory holds the two disk files and the main grid program needed in order to easily set off multiple mining turtles at once and to help clean them all up afterward.

The directory also holds an additional folder named movement used for ease of turtle movement. Some simple programs to quickly re-orientate turtles to your liking without having to mine and place them over and over again

## Usage

`grid <Radius> <Width> <Length> [Boolean Remove]`

The grid starts with a radius to use, a width (how far foward it will go), and a length (how far to the right it will go).

Using these values, it will be able to create a large grid.

## starting

When ready to use, choose the parameters desired and placed a disk drive, your chests, the programmer floppy disk, and your turtles on the bottom row (slots 13-16). Ensure they are placed in that order exactly

## cleanup

When complete, ensure turtle is placed ontop of the chest in the first block intiially created and repeat settings simply adding true as a final parameter.

**Ensure that disk drive and the eraser floppy disk are placed in their respective slots (slots 13 and 15 respectively)**

# Minecopy

The program can be installed, both in singleplayer and multiplayer, using a program named minecopy.

As the program is dated and the original source of the program is no longer up, I will include the program, and it's associated CC0 license here

## Side note: 
Please ensure you are in a safe sitaution when programming lare files such as the Quarry. Once the programming begins, it is hard to stop.

Last thing anyone wants to hear once they have started programming is the infamious creeper hiss afterall
