Project is created for the ComputerCraft mod.
GH: https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft
CF: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/computercraft

Multiple versions are included such that older versions of the mod can still run older versions of the program.

Newer versions of the program include more features such as remote RS communication and simple security with a failsafe

The program can be installed, both in singleplayer and multiplayer, using a program named minecopy.

As the program is dated and the original source of the program is no longer up, I will include the program, and it's associated CC0 license here
